## 🧠 Project Overview

This project investigates factors contributing to low customer satisfaction scores in Airbnb listings across six U.S. cities from 2012 to 2017. The analysis aims to help Airbnb and its hosts improve overall guest experience by identifying key drivers behind ratings under 90 out of 100.
